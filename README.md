1. Iris Species Classification:
   - Description: The Iris Species Classification project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
   - Goal: The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be trained to accurately classify different species of iris flowers based on their physical characteristics.

2. Movie Rating Prediction:
   - Description: Movie Rating Prediction involves developing a predictive model that can estimate the rating or popularity of a movie based on various features such as genre, cast, director, budget, and user reviews.
   - Goal: The objective of this project is to create a tool that can assist movie producers, distributors, and streaming platforms in predicting the potential success or audience reception of a movie before its release.

3. Sales Prediction:
   - Description: Sales Prediction aims to forecast future sales of a product or service based on historical sales data, marketing efforts, seasonality, and other relevant factors.
   - Goal: The aim of this project is to help businesses optimize inventory management, allocate resources effectively, and improve overall sales performance by providing accurate sales forecasts.

4. Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection:
   - Description: Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection involves building a model that can automatically identify fraudulent transactions based on patterns such as unusual spending behavior, location discrepancies, and transaction frequency.
   - Goal: The primary goal of this project is to minimize financial losses for credit card companies and protect cardholders from fraudulent activities by accurately detecting and flagging suspicious transactions in real-time.

5. Titanic Survival Prediction:
   - Description: Titanic Survival Prediction focuses on predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not based on factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and family relations.
   - Goal: This project aims to analyze historical data from the Titanic disaster to understand the factors that influenced survival rates and develop a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of survival for passengers under similar circumstances.
